# Turing Machine
Simulates a Turing Machine read from standard input.
The program has the following capabilities:
* step -> returns the next configuration of the Turing Machine
* accept -> returns a boolean value if given Turing Machine accepts the word given 
* k_accept -> same as accept, only the Machine has to finish in k steps, otherwise it returns False
